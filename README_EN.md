# oh-story-claudecode

A web novel writing skill pack for Claude Code and OpenClaw. Covers the full pipeline for long-form and short-form Chinese web novels: trend scanning, deconstruction, writing, AI tone removal, and cover generation.

## Core Approach

> **Tropes = deterministic emotional payoff**

Professional authors follow a three-step method:

1. **Scan** — analyze trending charts, identify genres, characters, and entry points.
2. **Deconstruct** — break down pacing and plot materials, build a personal module library.
3. **Commercialize** — learn and apply hooks, payoff density, expectation management.

Built around four pillars: reverse-engineering hits · plot modularization · layered state management · human-AI collaboration.

## Installation

**Option 1** Tell Claude Code / OpenClaw directly:

```
Install this skill https://github.com/worldwonderer/oh-story-claudecode
```

**Option 2** Command line:

```bash
npx skills add worldwonderer/oh-story-claudecode -y -g
```

`-g` installs globally (available in every directory); drop `-g` to install only into the current directory. Re-run the same command to update.

> After updating, if a project has already run `/story-setup`, re-run `/story-setup` from the project root to sync hooks / agents / references. Per-version changes are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [Releases](https://github.com/worldwonderer/oh-story-claudecode/releases).

> **Multi-agent collaboration needs setup + a fresh session**: the 7 specialist agents (story-architect, narrative-writer, consistency-checker, etc.) are written into your project's `.claude/agents/` by `/story-setup`. Claude Code only registers custom agents **at session start**, so **after `/story-setup` finishes you must open a new Claude Code session** before story-review's multi-perspective review and the agent collaboration in the writing flow take effect; otherwise skills get "subagent_type unavailable" and fall back to solo (single perspective). To check: run `/story-review` in the new session — a header of `Effective Mode: full/lean` means agents registered, `Fallback: ... -> solo` means you're still in the old session.

```

Long-form deconstruction also produces `文风.md`, plus `剧情/节奏.md` (pacing, key-info progression, emotional trigger eruption rhythm) and `剧情/情绪模块.md` (reader needs, emotional engine, reusable writing modules); daily writing consumes these through `对标/{书名}/剧情/` to keep voice, pacing, and emotion modules close to the benchmark.

<summary>Deconstruction demo — Once I Hid My Love (曾将爱意私藏, short-form)</summary>

`/story-short-analyze` deconstructing the short story 《曾将爱意私藏》 (~8,500 chars, win-back / "faked-death" genre):

```
demo/拆文库-曾将爱意私藏/
├── 原文/原文.txt        # Source backup
├── 拆文报告.md          # Story core + 5-dim scores + 6-facet payoff + cognitive reversal + 9-layer resonance
├── 情节节点.md          # 54 plot points (source quotes + emotion markers −9~+9)
├── 写作手法.md          # POV / dialogue / info-gap / object-hook — 11 techniques
└── _meta.json           # structure_counts (Phase 7 gate basis)
```

Short-form deconstruction outputs `拆文报告 / 情节节点 / 写作手法`; downstream `/story-short-write` writes a new same-genre story from them.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Import demo — 让你管账号，你高燃混剪炸全网 (long-form continuation project)</summary>

`/story-import` reverse-builds the author's already-published first 20 chapters (~37k chars) into a continuation-ready writing project, handed off to `/story-long-write` for daily writing from chapter 21:

```
demo/让你管账号，你高燃混剪炸全网/
├── 正文/        Chapters 001–020 (published source text)
├── 大纲/        大纲.md · 卷纲_第1卷.md · 细纲_第001–020章.md (one file per chapter)
├── 设定/        角色/ (6 character files) · 世界观/{background · cheat-system}
│                关系.md · 题材定位.md · 文风.md
├── 追踪/        伏笔.md (foreshadowing) · 时间线.md (timeline) · 角色状态.md (state) · 上下文.md
└── 参考资料/    作品信息.md
```

Per-chapter extraction (events / characters / settings / foreshadowing / timeline) is reverse-engineered into a continuation bible, so the author seamlessly continues from chapter 21.

</details>

## Agent System

Writing skills internally coordinate 7 specialized agents:

| Agent | Model | Role |
|:------|:------|:-----|
| **story-architect** | Opus | Story architecture — genre positioning, outline structure, hook/twist design, emotion arcs |
| **character-designer** | Sonnet | Character design — profiles, voice, motivation chains, dialogue writing |
| **narrative-writer** | Sonnet | Narrative writer — prose writing, de-AI-ify, format compliance |
| **consistency-checker** | Haiku | Consistency check — fact conflict scanning, foreshadowing tracking, S1-S4 grading reports |
| **story-researcher** | Sonnet | Research — CDP search + full-text extraction, multi-source cross-verification, structured reference files |
| **story-explorer** | Haiku | Story query — read-only character/foreshadowing/setting/progress lookup, quick context loading |
| **chapter-extractor** | Haiku | Chapter extraction — summaries, plot points, character mentions, parallel deconstruction unit |

Agents load writing theory from `references/` on demand (character design, dialogue techniques, twist toolbox, etc. — 100+ methodology files), without reserving context window space.

## Automation Hooks

7 hooks deployed automatically by `/story-setup`:

| Hook | Trigger | Function |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| session-start.sh | Session start | Display branch, progress snapshot, deconstruction status |
| session-end.sh | Session end | Log session to `追踪/session-log.txt` |
| detect-story-gaps.sh | Session start | Detect setting gaps, missing outlines, foreshadowing breaks |
| pre-compact.sh | Before context compaction | Save progress snapshot path and line-count summary |
| post-compact.sh | After context compaction | Prompt to read progress snapshot for context recovery |
| validate-story-commit.sh | git commit | Check hardcoded attributes, setting required fields (warning only, non-blocking) |
| guard-outline-before-prose.sh | Before writing prose (Write/Edit) | Blocks first creation of a chapter/story body when its 细纲/小节大纲 is missing (blocking) — enforces outline-first |

## Project File Structure

A long-form novel can easily reach hundreds of thousands of words across hundreds of chapters. Setting conflicts, broken foreshadowing, timeline inconsistencies — relying on memory alone is a recipe for disaster.

The file system separates settings, outlines, prose, and tracking into independent dimensions. The conversation handles creation; the file system handles memory.

**Long-form:**

```
{Book Title}/
├── Settings/
│   ├── World/              # Background, power systems, etc. — one file per topic
│   ├── Characters/         # One file per character (Shen_Zhi.md, Lu_Yanzhi.md)
│   ├── Factions/           # One file per faction/organization (Tianji_Pavilion.md)
│   ├── Relationships.md    # Character relationship map
│   └── Genre_Positioning.md # Core trope + benchmark analysis
├── Outline/
│   ├── Outline.md          # Full-book volume-level structure
│   ├── Volume_1.md         # One per volume: payoff pacing + emotion arc + character arc + foreshadowing + twists
│   ├── Chapter_001.md      # One per chapter: events + hooks + payoffs + suspense
│   └── ...
├── Prose/
│   ├── Chapter_001_Title.md
│   └── ...
├── Benchmark/                # Benchmark reference (structured subdirs synced from deconstruction)

│   ├── Timeline.md          # In-story timeline (full-book)
│   └── Character_Status.md  # Character current state snapshots (per-chapter)
├── References/              # story-researcher output
│   └── {topic}.md           # Split by research topic
```

**Short-form file structure:**

```
短篇/{Title}/
├── 正文.md                  # Final draft
├── 小节大纲.md              # 8-section structure + emotion curve
└── 拆文库/                  # If a reference novel exists (analyze output)
    └── {Book}/
        ├── 拆文报告.md
        ├── 情节节点.md
        └── 写作手法.md
```

**Deconstruction Library:** Deconstruction skills save structured outputs (characters, plotlines, settings, chapters) under `拆文库/{Book Title}/` at project root; long-form plot output includes `节奏.md` and `情绪模块.md`. Writing skills consume these assets through `对标/{书名}/剧情/` and related benchmark subdirectories, or automatically fall back to reading from the deconstruction library.
